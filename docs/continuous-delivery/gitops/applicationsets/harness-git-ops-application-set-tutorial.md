## Prerequisites

To set up an ApplicationSet use case, you'll need the following:

* Create a [Harness GitOps agent](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/use-gitops/install-a-harness-git-ops-agent) to create the ApplicationSet.
* Create 2 target [clusters](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/get-started/harness-cd-git-ops-quickstart#step-3-add-a-harness-gitops-cluster) dev, prod to deploy the child applications.
* GitHub account. You will be cloning the Argo Project's [ApplicationSet repo](https://github.com/argoproj/applicationset) and using one of its examples.
* Create [Harness GitOps repository](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/get-started/harness-cd-git-ops-quickstart#step-2-add-a-harness-gitops-repository) with the Argo Project's ApplicationSet repo. We will be using one of its [examples](https://github.com/argoproj/applicationset/tree/master/examples).

## Steps

### Step 1: Updating manifests in Git

The example we use has [Git generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Git/) and is in in [Argo projectâ€™s public repository](https://github.com/argoproj/applicationset/tree/master/examples/git-generator-files-discovery).

1. Clone the repo and update `git-generator-files.yaml` with the following YAML keys/values and save the changes.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1  
kind: ApplicationSet  
metadata:  
  name: guestbook  
spec:  
  generators:  
    - git:  
        repoURL: https://github.com/<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>/applicationset.git  
        revision: HEAD  
        files:  
        - path: "examples/git-generator-files-discovery/cluster-config/**/config.json"  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      name: '{{cluster.name}}-guestbook'
      labels: 
        harness.io/envRef: '{{envTag}}'
        harness.io/serviceRef: '{{serviceTag}}'
        harness.io/buildRef: '{{releaseTag}}'
    spec:  
      project: <PROJECT_ID_IN_AGENT_PAGE>  
      source:  
        repoURL: https://github.com/<your account name>/applicationset.git  
        targetRevision: HEAD  
        path: "examples/git-generator-files-discovery/apps/guestbook"  
      destination:  
        server: '{{cluster.address}}'  
        namespace: default  
      syncPolicy:  
        automated: {}
```
To get the project id, go to the Agents page and find the Argo project id you want to create the ApplicationSet.

2. Navigate to `applicationset/examples/git-generator-files-discovery/cluster-config/engineering/dev/config.json`. Replace `"address": "https://1.2.3.4"` with the Endpoint IP address for the target cluster, **dev**. Ensure that you use the `https://` scheme.
Note that, this cluster should be created beforehand.

3. Repeat step 2 for target cluster, **prod** by modifying file in path `applicationset/examples/git-generator-files-discovery/cluster-config/engineering/prod/config.json`
Here is an example,

:::note

Both JSON and YAML formats are supported for ApplicationSets.

### Step 2: Creating ApplicationSet app

1. Just like how you create a regular application in GitOps, click **Applications**, and then click **New Application**.
2. Enter the name, choose the agent, leave the default **Sync Policy** settings, and click **Continue**.
3. In **Source**, enter the following settings and then click **Continue**.
    1. **Repository URL**: select the GitOps Repository you added earlier.
    2. **Target Revision**: select **master**.
    3. **Path**: enter **examples/git-generator-files-discovery** and click **+** to add it.

4. In **Destination**, select the **cluster and namespace in which the GitOps agent is installed**.

### Step 3: Sync the ApplicationSet app

Syncing can be done from 2 places, Application view or PR pipeline. For syncing via the PR pipeline, please refer to [bullet 4](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/use-gitops/sync-gitops-applications/).

From the Application view, you can sync the Harness ApplicationSet Application or the individual Applications independently.

If you configure automatic syncing in the ApplicationSet template, then the Applications will be synced automatically. See `syncPolicy.automated` in the below example,

```yaml
  template:  
    metadata:  
      name: '{{cluster.name}}-guestbook'  
    spec:  
      project: 191b68fc  
      source:  
        repoURL: https://github.com/johndoe/applicationset.git  
        targetRevision: HEAD  
        path: "examples/git-generator-files-discovery/apps/guestbook"  
      destination:  
        server: '{{cluster.address}}'  
        namespace: default  
      syncPolicy:  
        automated: {}
```
